    "Optical flow is the patten of motion of objects between two consecutive frames due to movement of the object or camera. Mathematically it is a vector  field that shows the displacement vectors of pixels (points) between the frames.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The background lighting intensity is not changing\n",
    "- Near pixels have similar motion\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to cover the underlying mathematical principles, as multiple Python libraries already come with functions that calculate optical flow for you.\n",
